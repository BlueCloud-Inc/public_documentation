## Cohort Builder 
The Cohort Management App is a powerful tool that enables you to build, schedule, and manage custom data cohorts using your own secure dataâ€”no data is stored or transferred outside your environment. It streamlines the process of creating scheduled cohort tables in various forms (dynamic, snapshot, or one-time), ensuring that your insights remain fresh and actionable while supporting seamless team collaboration.
